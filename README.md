# EventTimer


This simple program allows to set up different events and get notified at a specified time. Please be aware of the following:

- the instance of the program has to run the whole time and events are immediately forgotten after the program is closed. 
- the event to be notified has to be at the same day
- all text fields and buttons are in German
- I do not guarantee at all any functionality of the program and are not responsible for any missed event:)


## Motivation

I wrote this little program in 2011 to get notified about some events when I was working at the computer. For instance, I wanted to get notified that I should not forget to have something for dinner while I was programming or studying. 

## Installation

Download the [.jar-file](EventNotifier.jar). To load and compile the source code an additional library info.clearthought.layout is required. Download the TableLayout.jar e.g. from here:
